# Lotka-Volterra-equations
This is a Bachelor's degree exam. The aim of the projetc is to solve Lotka-Volterra differential eqautions that describe the dynamic of biological system, in which two entitites, a predator and a prey, interact. It has been used Runke-Kutta algorithm to solve the differential equations. The Phase-space plot is provided with OpenGL.
